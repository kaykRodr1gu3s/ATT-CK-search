descripition text: "Adversaries may rent Virtual Private Servers (VPSs)\_that can\
  \ be used during targeting. There exist a variety of cloud service providers that\
  \ will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. By utilizing a VPS, adversaries\
  \ can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. The use of cloud\
  \ infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify,\
  \ and shut down their infrastructure.Acquiring a VPS for use in later stages of\
  \ the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to\
  \ benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service\
  \ providers. Adversaries may also acquire infrastructure from VPS service providers\
  \ that are known for renting VPSs with minimal registration information, allowing\
  \ for more anonymous acquisitions of infrastructure.[1]"
