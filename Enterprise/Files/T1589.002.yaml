descripition text: 'Adversaries may gather email addresses that can be used during
  targeting. Even if internal instances exist, organizations may have public-facing
  email infrastructure and addresses for employees.Adversaries may easily gather email
  addresses, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible
  data sets (ex: Social Media or Search Victim-Owned Websites).[1][2] Email addresses
  could also be enumerated via more active means (i.e. Active Scanning), such as probing
  and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames
  in a system.[3] For example, adversaries may be able to enumerate email addresses
  in Office 365 environments by querying a variety of publicly available API endpoints,
  such as autodiscover and GetCredentialType.[4][5]Gathering this information may
  reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains
  or Phishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex: Email Accounts),
  and/or initial access (ex: Phishing or Brute Force via External Remote Services).'
