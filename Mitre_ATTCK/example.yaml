descripition text: 'Adversaries may set up their own Domain Name System (DNS) servers
  that can be used during targeting. During post-compromise activity, adversaries
  may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex:
  Application Layer Protocol). Instead of hijacking existing DNS servers, adversaries
  may opt to configure and run their own DNS servers in support of operations.By running
  their own DNS servers, adversaries can have more control over how they administer
  server-side DNS C2 traffic (DNS). With control over a DNS server, adversaries can
  configure DNS applications to provide conditional responses to malware and, generally,
  have more flexibility in the structure of the DNS-based C2 channel.[1]'
