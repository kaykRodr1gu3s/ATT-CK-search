Name: Transfer Data to Cloud Account
Tactic: Exfiltration
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups of
    cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service
    to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection.A
    defender who is monitoring for large transfers to outside the cloud environment
    through normal file transfers or over command and control channels may not be
    watching for data transfers to another account within the same cloud provider.
    Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address
    space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers
    over external network interfaces.Incidents have been observed where adversaries
    have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.[1] '
