Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a different network medium than
    the command and control channel. If the command and control network is a wired
    Internet connection, the exfiltration may occur, for example, over a WiFi connection,
    modem, cellular data connection, Bluetooth, or another radio frequency (RF) channel.Adversaries
    may choose to do this if they have sufficient access or proximity, and the connection
    might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel
    because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.
