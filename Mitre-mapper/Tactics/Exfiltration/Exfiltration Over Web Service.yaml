Name: Exfiltration Over Web Service
Tactic: Exfiltration
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate
    data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services
    acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due
    to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them
    prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to
    these services.Web service providers also commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving
    adversaries an added level of protection.
