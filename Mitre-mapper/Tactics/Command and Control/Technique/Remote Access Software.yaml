Name: Remote Access Software
Tactic: Command and Control
Description:
  Description:
  - An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software to
    establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within
    networks. These services, such as VNC, Team Viewer, AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, LogMein,
    AmmyyAdmin, and other remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, are commonly
    used as legitimate technical support software and may be allowed by application
    control within a target environment.[1][2][3]Remote access software may be installed
    and used post-compromise as an alternate communications channel for redundant
    access or as a way to establish an interactive remote desktop session with the
    target system. They may also be used as a component of malware to establish a
    reverse connection or back-connect to a service or adversary controlled system.Adversaries
    may similarly abuse response features included in EDR and other defensive tools
    that enable remote access.Installation of many remote access software may also
    include persistence (e.g., the software's installation routine creates a Windows
    Service).
