  Description:
  - Adversaries may employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control
    traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication
    protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be
    vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated
    within malware samples/configuration files.
