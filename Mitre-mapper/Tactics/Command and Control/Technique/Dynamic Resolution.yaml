Name: Dynamic Resolution
Tactic: Command and Control
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure
    to evade common detections and remediations. This may be achieved by using malware
    that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive
    the malware's communications. These calculations can be used to dynamically adjust
    parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses
    for command and control.Adversaries may use dynamic resolution for the purpose
    of Fallback Channels. When contact is lost with the primary command and control
    server malware may employ dynamic resolution as a means to reestablishing command
    and control.[1][2][3]
