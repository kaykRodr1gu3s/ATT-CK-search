Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for
    relaying data to/from a compromised system. Popular websites and social media
    acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the
    likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior
    to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter,
    makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers
    commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.Use
    of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through
    malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this
    infrastructure may be dynamically changed).
