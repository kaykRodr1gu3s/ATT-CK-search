  Description:
  - Adversaries may encode data to make the content of command and control traffic
    more difficult to detect. Command and control (C2) information can be encoded
    using a standard data encoding system. Use of data encoding may adhere to existing
    protocol specifications and includes use of ASCII, Unicode, Base64, MIME, or other
    binary-to-text and character encoding systems.[1] [2] Some data encoding systems
    may also result in data compression, such as gzip.
