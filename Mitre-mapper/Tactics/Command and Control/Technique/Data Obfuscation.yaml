Name: Data Obfuscation
Tactic: Command and Control
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may obfuscate command and control traffic to make it more difficult
    to detect. Command and control (C2) communications are hidden (but not necessarily
    encrypted) in an attempt to make the content more difficult to discover or decipher
    and to make the communication less conspicuous and hide commands from being seen.
    This encompasses many methods, such as adding junk data to protocol traffic, using
    steganography, or impersonating legitimate protocols. '
