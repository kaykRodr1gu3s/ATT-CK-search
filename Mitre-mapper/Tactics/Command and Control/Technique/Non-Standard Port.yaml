Tactic: Command and Control
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that are typically
    not associated. For example, HTTPS over port 8088[1] or port 587[2] as opposed
    to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port
    used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.Adversaries
    may also make changes to victim systems to abuse non-standard ports. For example,
    Registry keys and other configuration settings can be used to modify protocol
    and port pairings.[3]
