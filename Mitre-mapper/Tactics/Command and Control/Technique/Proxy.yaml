Name: Proxy
Tactic: Command and Control
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems
    or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control
    server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that
    enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including HTRAN,
    ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. [1] Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command
    and control communications, reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network
    connections, provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over
    existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion. Adversaries
    may chain together multiple proxies to further disguise the source of malicious
    traffic.Adversaries can also take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery
    Networks (CDNs) to proxy command and control traffic.
