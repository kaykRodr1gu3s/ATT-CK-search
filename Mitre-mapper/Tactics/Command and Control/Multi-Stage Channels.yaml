Name: Multi-Stage Channels
Tactic: Command and Control
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed
    under different conditions or for certain functions. Use of multiple stages may
    obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.Remote
    access tools will call back to the first-stage command and control server for
    instructions. The first stage may have automated capabilities to collect basic
    host information, update tools, and upload additional files. A second remote access
    tool (RAT) could be uploaded at that point to redirect the host to the second-stage
    command and control server. The second stage will likely be more fully featured
    and allow the adversary to interact with the system through a reverse shell and
    additional RAT features.The different stages will likely be hosted separately
    with no overlapping infrastructure. The loader may also have backup first-stage
    callbacks or Fallback Channels in case the original first-stage communication
    path is discovered and blocked.
