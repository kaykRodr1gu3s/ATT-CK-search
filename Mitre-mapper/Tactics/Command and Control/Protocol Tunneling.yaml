Name: Protocol Tunneling
Tactic: Command and Control
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within
    a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or enable access
    to otherwise unreachable systems. Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating
    a protocol within another. This behavior may conceal malicious traffic by blending
    in with existing traffic and/or provide an outer layer of encryption (similar
    to a VPN). Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise
    not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or other traffic that
    would be filtered by network appliances or not routed over the Internet. There
    are various means to encapsulate a protocol within another protocol. For example,
    adversaries may perform SSH tunneling (also known as SSH port forwarding), which
    involves forwarding arbitrary data over an encrypted SSH tunnel.[1] Protocol Tunneling
    may also be abused by adversaries during Dynamic Resolution. Known as DNS over
    HTTPS (DoH), queries to resolve C2 infrastructure may be encapsulated within encrypted
    HTTPS packets.[2] Adversaries may also leverage Protocol Tunneling in conjunction
    with Proxy and/or Protocol Impersonation to further conceal C2 communications
    and infrastructure. '
