  Description:
  - Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory prior
    to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file
    through techniques such as Archive Collected Data. Interactive command shells
    may be used, and common functionality within cmd and bash may be used to copy
    data into a staging location.[1]In cloud environments, adversaries may stage data
    within a particular instance or virtual machine before exfiltration. An adversary
    may Create Cloud Instance and stage data in that instance.[2]Adversaries may choose
    to stage data from a victim network in a centralized location prior to Exfiltration
    to minimize the number of connections made to their C2 server and better evade
    detection.
