  Description:
  - An adversary may compress and/or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration.
    Compressing the data can help to obfuscate the collected data and minimize the
    amount of data sent over the network. Encryption can be used to hide information
    that is being exfiltrated from detection or make exfiltration less conspicuous
    upon inspection by a defender.Both compression and encryption are done prior to
    exfiltration, and can be performed using a utility, 3rd party library, or custom
    method.
