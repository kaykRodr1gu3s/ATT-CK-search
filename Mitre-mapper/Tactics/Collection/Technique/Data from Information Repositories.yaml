  Description:
  - Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information.
    Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically
    to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store
    a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct
    access to the target information. Adversaries may also abuse external sharing
    features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.
    The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value
    to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:Policies, procedures,
    and standardsPhysical / logical network diagramsSystem architecture diagramsTechnical
    system documentationTesting / development credentialsWork / project schedulesSource
    code snippetsLinks to network shares and other internal resourcesInformation stored
    in a repository may vary based on the specific instance or environment. Specific
    common information repositories include web-based platforms such as Sharepoint
    and Confluence, specific services such as Code Repositories, IaaS databases, enterprise
    databases, and other storage infrastructure such as SQL Server.
