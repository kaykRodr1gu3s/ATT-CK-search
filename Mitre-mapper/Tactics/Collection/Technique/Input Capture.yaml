Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect
    information. During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to various
    different locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input
    capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. Credential API Hooking)
    or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be
    a genuine service (e.g. Web Portal Capture).
