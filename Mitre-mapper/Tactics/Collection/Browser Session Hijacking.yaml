  Description:
  - Adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality
    in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information
    as part of various browser session hijacking techniques.[1]A specific example
    is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows them to inherit
    cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user then use the browser
    as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet.[2][3] Executing browser-based
    behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as SeDebugPrivilege
    and/or high-integrity/administrator rights.Another example involves pivoting browser
    traffic from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up
    a proxy which will redirect web traffic. This does not alter the user's traffic
    in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is
    closed. The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process
    the proxy is injected into. Browsers typically create a new process for each tab
    that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly. With
    these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an
    intranet, such as Sharepoint or webmail, that is accessible through the browser
    and which the browser has sufficient permissions. Browser pivoting may also bypass
    security provided by 2-factor authentication.[4]
