Name: Create or Modify System Process
Tactic: Persistence
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute
    malicious payloads as part of persistence. When operating systems boot up, they
    can start processes that perform background system functions. On Windows and Linux,
    these system processes are referred to as services.[1] On macOS, launchd processes
    known as Launch Daemon and Launch Agent are run to finish system initialization
    and load user specific parameters.[2] Adversaries may install new services, daemons,
    or agents that can be configured to execute at startup or a repeatable interval
    in order to establish persistence. Similarly, adversaries may modify existing
    services, daemons, or agents to achieve the same effect.  Services, daemons, or
    agents may be created with administrator privileges but executed under root/SYSTEM
    privileges. Adversaries may leverage this functionality to create or modify system
    processes in order to escalate privileges.[3] '
