Name: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
Tactic: Persistence
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may configure system settings to automatically execute a program during
    system boot or logon to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on
    compromised systems. Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running
    a program on system boot or account logon.[1][2][3][4][5] These mechanisms may
    include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated
    directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information,
    such as the Windows Registry. An adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying
    or extending features of the kernel.Since some boot or logon autostart programs
    run with higher privileges, an adversary may leverage these to elevate privileges.
