Name: Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts
Tactic: Persistence
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization
    to establish persistence. Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative
    functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal
    logging server. These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied
    locally or remotely.  Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence
    on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts,
    either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. An adversary
    may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization
    scripts run with higher privileges.
