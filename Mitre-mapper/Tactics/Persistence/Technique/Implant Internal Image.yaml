Name: Implant Internal Image
Tactic: Persistence
Description:
  Description:
  - "Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish\
    \ persistence after gaining access to an environment. Amazon Web Services (AWS)\
    \ Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure\
    \ Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted\
    \ or backdoored. Unlike Upload Malware, this technique focuses on adversaries\
    \ implanting an image in a registry within a victim\u2019s environment. Depending\
    \ on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access\
    \ if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest\
    \ image.[1]A tool has been developed to facilitate planting backdoors in cloud\
    \ container images.[2] If an adversary has access to a compromised AWS instance,\
    \ and permissions to list the available container images, they may implant a backdoor\
    \ such as a Web Shell.[1]"
