Name: Account Manipulation
Tactic: Persistence
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain and/or elevate access to victim
    systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves or modifies
    adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission
    groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert
    security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password
    duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to
    create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions
    on systems or the domain. However, account manipulation may also lead to privilege
    escalation where modifications grant access to additional roles, permissions,
    or higher-privileged Valid Accounts.
