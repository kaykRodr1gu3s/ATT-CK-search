Name: Compromise Client Software Binary
Tactic: Persistence
Description:
  Description:
  - "Adversaries may modify client software binaries to establish persistent access\
    \ to systems. Client software enables users to access services provided by a server.\
    \ Common client software types are SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, and\
    \ web browsers.Adversaries may make modifications to client software binaries\
    \ to carry out malicious tasks when those applications are in use. For example,\
    \ an adversary may copy source code for the client software, add a backdoor, compile\
    \ for the target, and replace the legitimate application binary (or support files)\
    \ with the backdoored one. An adversary may also modify an existing binary by\
    \ patching in malicious functionality (e.g., IAT Hooking/Entry point patching)[1]\
    \ prior to the binary\u2019s legitimate execution. For example, an adversary may\
    \ modify the entry point of a binary to point to malicious code patched in by\
    \ the adversary before resuming normal execution flow.[2]Since these applications\
    \ may be routinely executed by the user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent\
    \ access to the host."
