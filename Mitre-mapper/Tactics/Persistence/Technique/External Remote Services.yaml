  Description:
  - "Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access\
    \ and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other\
    \ access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources\
    \ from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage\
    \ connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such\
    \ as Windows Remote Management and VNC can also be used externally.[1]Access to\
    \ Valid Accounts to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained\
    \ through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after\
    \ compromising the enterprise network.[2] Access to remote services may be used\
    \ as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.Access may\
    \ also be gained through an exposed service that doesn\u2019t require authentication.\
    \ In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes\
    \ API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.[3][4]"
