  Description:
  - Adversaries may abuse Internet browser extensions to establish persistent access
    to victim systems. Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add
    functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers. They can be installed
    directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions
    to everything that the browser can access.[1][2]Malicious extensions can be installed
    into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate
    extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised
    a system. Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult
    for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.[3] Depending on the browser,
    adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from
    an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to
    silently install additional extensions.Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could
    silently install browser extensions via the command line using the profiles tool
    to install malicious .mobileconfig files. In macOS 11+, the use of the profiles
    tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however .mobileconfig files
    can be planted and installed with user interaction.[4]Once the extension is installed,
    it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user
    enters into a browser (including credentials), and be used as an installer for
    a RAT for persistence.[5][6][7][8]There have also been instances of botnets using
    a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions.[9] There have also
    been similar examples of extensions being used for command & control.[10]
