Name: Hijack Execution Flow
Tactic: Persistence
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating
    systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence,
    since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use
    these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application
    control or other restrictions on execution.There are many ways an adversary may
    hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system
    locates programs to be executed. How the operating system locates libraries to
    be used by a program can also be intercepted. Locations where the operating system
    looks for programs/resources, such as file directories and in the case of Windows
    the Registry, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.
