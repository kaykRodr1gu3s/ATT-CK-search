Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems. With a
    sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary
    credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed
    on the system.Accounts may be created on the local system or within a domain or
    cloud tenant. In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only
    have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection.
