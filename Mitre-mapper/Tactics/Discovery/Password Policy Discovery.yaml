  Description:
  - Adversaries may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy
    used within an enterprise network or cloud environment. Password policies are
    a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through
    Brute Force. This information may help the adversary to create a list of common
    passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the
    policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords
    such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the
    lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).Password policies can be set
    and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems via various command shell
    utilities such as net accounts (/domain), Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy, chage
    -l , cat /etc/pam.d/common-password, and pwpolicy getaccountpolicies [1] [2].
    Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to discover
    password policy information (e.g. show aaa, show aaa common-criteria policy all).[3]Password
    policies can be discovered in cloud environments using available APIs such as
    GetAccountPasswordPolicy in AWS [4].
