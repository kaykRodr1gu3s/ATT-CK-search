  Description:
  - "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts\
    \ and local network infrastructure devices, including those that may be vulnerable\
    \ to remote software exploitation. Common methods to acquire this information\
    \ include port and/or vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a\
    \ system.[1] Within cloud environments, adversaries may attempt to discover services\
    \ running on other cloud hosts. Additionally, if the cloud environment is connected\
    \ to a on-premises environment, adversaries may be able to identify services running\
    \ on non-cloud systems as well.Within macOS environments, adversaries may use\
    \ the native Bonjour application to discover services running on other macOS hosts\
    \ within a network. The Bonjour mDNSResponder daemon automatically registers and\
    \ advertises a host\u2019s registered services on the network. For example, adversaries\
    \ can use a mDNS query (such as dns-sd -B _ssh._tcp .) to find other systems broadcasting\
    \ the ssh service.[2][3]"
