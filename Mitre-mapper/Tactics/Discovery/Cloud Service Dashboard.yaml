Description:
  Description:
  - An adversary may use a cloud service dashboard GUI with stolen credentials to
    gain useful information from an operational cloud environment, such as specific
    services, resources, and features. For example, the GCP Command Center can be
    used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional
    queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports.[1]Depending on the
    configuration of the environment, an adversary may be able to enumerate more information
    via the graphical dashboard than an API. This allows the adversary to gain information
    without making any API requests.
