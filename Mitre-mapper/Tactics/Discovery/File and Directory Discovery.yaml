Name: File and Directory Discovery
Tactic: Discovery
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations
    of a host or network share for certain information within a file system. Adversaries
    may use the information from File and Directory Discovery during automated discovery
    to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects
    the target and/or attempts specific actions.Many command shell utilities can be
    used to obtain this information. Examples include dir, tree, ls, find, and locate.[1]
    Custom tools may also be used to gather file and directory information and interact
    with the Native API. Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network
    devices to gather file and directory information (e.g. dir, show flash, and/or
    nvram).[2]
