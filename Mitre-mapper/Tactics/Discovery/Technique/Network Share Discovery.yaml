  Description:
  - Adversaries may look for folders and drives shared on remote systems as a means
    of identifying sources of information to gather as a precursor for Collection
    and to identify potential systems of interest for Lateral Movement. Networks often
    contain shared network drives and folders that enable users to access file directories
    on various systems across a network. File sharing over a Windows network occurs
    over the SMB protocol. [1] [2] Net can be used to query a remote system for available
    shared drives using the net view remotesystem command. It can also be used to
    query shared drives on the local system using net share. For macOS, the sharing
    -l command lists all shared points used for smb services.
