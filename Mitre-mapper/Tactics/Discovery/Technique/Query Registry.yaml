  Description:
  - Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about
    the system, configuration, and installed software.The Registry contains a significant
    amount of information about the operating system, configuration, software, and
    security.[1] Information can easily be queried using the Reg utility, though other
    means to access the Registry exist. Some of the information may help adversaries
    to further their operation within a network. Adversaries may use the information
    from Query Registry during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including
    whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific
    actions.
