  Description:
  - Adversaries may gather information on Group Policy settings to identify paths
    for privilege escalation, security measures applied within a domain, and to discover
    patterns in domain objects that can be manipulated or used to blend in the environment.
    Group Policy allows for centralized management of user and computer settings in
    Active Directory (AD). Group policy objects (GPOs) are containers for group policy
    settings made up of files stored within a predictable network path <DOMAIN>SYSVOL<DOMAIN>Policies.[1][2]Adversaries
    may use commands such as gpresult or various publicly available PowerShell functions,
    such as Get-DomainGPO and Get-DomainGPOLocalGroup, to gather information on Group
    Policy settings.[3][4] Adversaries may use this information to shape follow-on
    behaviors, including determining potential attack paths within the target network
    as well as opportunities to manipulate Group Policy settings (i.e. Domain Policy
    Modification) for their benefit.
