Name: Cloud Storage Object Discovery
Tactic: Discovery
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may enumerate objects in cloud storage infrastructure. Adversaries
    may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors,
    including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage.  Similar to File
    and Directory Discovery on a local host, after identifying available storage services
    (i.e. Cloud Infrastructure Discovery) adversaries may access the contents/objects
    stored in cloud infrastructure.Cloud service providers offer APIs allowing users
    to enumerate objects stored within cloud storage. Examples include ListObjectsV2
    in AWS [1] and List Blobs in Azure[2] .
