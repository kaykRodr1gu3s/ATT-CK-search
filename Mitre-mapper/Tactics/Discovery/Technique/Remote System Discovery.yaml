Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname,
    or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement
    from the current system. Functionality could exist within remote access tools
    to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be
    used such as  Ping or net view using Net.Adversaries may also analyze data from
    local host files (ex: C:WindowsSystem32Driversetchosts or /etc/hosts) or other
    passive means (such as local Arp cache entries) in order to discover the presence
    of remote systems in an environment.Adversaries may also target discovery of network
    infrastructure as well as leverage Network Device CLI commands on network devices
    to gather detailed information about systems within a network (e.g. show cdp neighbors,
    show arp).[1][2] '
