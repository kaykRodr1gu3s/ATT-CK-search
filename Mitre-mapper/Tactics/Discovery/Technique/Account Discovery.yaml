  Description:
  - "Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of valid accounts, usernames, or email\
    \ addresses on a system or within a compromised environment. This information\
    \ can help adversaries determine which accounts exist, which can aid in follow-on\
    \ behavior such as brute-forcing, spear-phishing attacks, or account takeovers\
    \ (e.g., Valid Accounts).Adversaries may use several methods to enumerate accounts,\
    \ including abuse of existing tools, built-in commands, and potential misconfigurations\
    \ that leak account names and roles or permissions in the targeted environment.For\
    \ examples, cloud environments typically provide easily accessible interfaces\
    \ to obtain user lists. On hosts, adversaries can use default PowerShell and other\
    \ command line functionality to identify accounts. Information about email addresses\
    \ and accounts may also be extracted by searching an infected system\u2019s files."
