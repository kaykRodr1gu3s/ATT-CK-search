  Description:
  - Adversaries may gather information in an attempt to calculate the geographical
    location of a victim host. Adversaries may use the information from System Location
    Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether
    or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.Adversaries
    may attempt to infer the location of a system using various system checks, such
    as time zone, keyboard layout, and/or language settings.[1][2][3] Windows API
    functions such as GetLocaleInfoW can also be used to determine the locale of the
    host.[1] In cloud environments, an instance's availability zone may also be discovered
    by accessing the instance metadata service from the instance.[4][5]Adversaries
    may also attempt to infer the location of a victim host using IP addressing, such
    as via online geolocation IP-lookup services.[6][2]
