Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may attempt to enumerate local device drivers on a victim host. Information
    about device drivers may highlight various insights that shape follow-on behaviors,
    such as the function/purpose of the host, present security tools (i.e. Security
    Software Discovery) or other defenses (e.g., Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion),
    as well as potential exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., Exploitation for Privilege
    Escalation).Many OS utilities may provide information about local device drivers,
    such as driverquery.exe and the EnumDeviceDrivers() API function on Windows.[1][2]
    Information about device drivers (as well as associated services, i.e., System
    Service Discovery) may also be available in the Registry.[3]On Linux/macOS, device
    drivers (in the form of kernel modules) may be visible within /dev or using utilities
    such as lsmod and modinfo.[4][5][6]
