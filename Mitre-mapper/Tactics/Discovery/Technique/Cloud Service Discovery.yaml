  Description:
  - An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud services running on a system after
    gaining access. These methods can differ from platform-as-a-service (PaaS), to
    infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), or software-as-a-service (SaaS). Many services
    exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration
    and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Lambda Functions, Azure AD, etc. They may also
    include security services, such as AWS GuardDuty and Microsoft Defender for Cloud,
    and logging services, such as AWS CloudTrail and Google Cloud Audit Logs.Adversaries
    may attempt to discover information about the services enabled throughout the
    environment. Azure tools and APIs, such as the Azure AD Graph API and Azure Resource
    Manager API, can enumerate resources and services, including applications, management
    groups, resources and policy definitions, and their relationships that are accessible
    by an identity.[1][2]For example, Stormspotter is an open source tool for enumerating
    and constructing a graph for Azure resources and services, and Pacu is an open
    source AWS exploitation framework that supports several methods for discovering
    cloud services.[3][4]Adversaries may use the information gained to shape follow-on
    behaviors, such as targeting data or credentials from enumerated services or evading
    identified defenses through Disable or Modify Tools or Disable or Modify Cloud
    Logs.
