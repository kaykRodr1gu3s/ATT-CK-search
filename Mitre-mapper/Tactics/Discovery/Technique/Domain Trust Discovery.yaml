Name: Domain Trust Discovery
Tactic: Discovery
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may attempt to gather information on domain trust relationships that
    may be used to identify lateral movement opportunities in Windows multi-domain/forest
    environments. Domain trusts provide a mechanism for a domain to allow access to
    resources based on the authentication procedures of another domain.[1] Domain
    trusts allow the users of the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting
    domain. The information discovered may help the adversary conduct SID-History
    Injection, Pass the Ticket, and Kerberoasting.[2][3] Domain trusts can be enumerated
    using the DSEnumerateDomainTrusts() Win32 API call, .NET methods, and LDAP.[3]
    The Windows utility Nltest is known to be used by adversaries to enumerate domain
    trusts.[4]
