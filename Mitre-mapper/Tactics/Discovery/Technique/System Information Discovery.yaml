  Description:
  - An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system
    and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture.
    Adversaries may use the information from System Information Discovery during automated
    discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary
    fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.Tools such as Systeminfo
    can be used to gather detailed system information. If running with privileged
    access, a breakdown of system data can be gathered through the systemsetup configuration
    tool on macOS. As an example, adversaries with user-level access can execute the
    df -aH command to obtain currently mounted disks and associated freely available
    space. Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to
    gather detailed system information (e.g. show version).[1] System Information
    Discovery combined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and
    reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment.[2][3]Infrastructure
    as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure allow access to
    instance and virtual machine information via APIs. Successful authenticated API
    calls can return data such as the operating system platform and status of a particular
    instance or the model view of a virtual machine.[4][5][6]
