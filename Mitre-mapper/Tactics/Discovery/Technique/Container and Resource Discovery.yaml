Tactic: Discovery
Description:
  Description:
  - "Adversaries may attempt to discover containers and other resources that are available\
    \ within a containers environment. Other resources may include images, deployments,\
    \ pods, nodes, and other information such as the status of a cluster.These resources\
    \ can be viewed within web applications such as the Kubernetes dashboard or can\
    \ be queried via the Docker and Kubernetes APIs.[1][2] In Docker, logs may leak\
    \ information about the environment, such as the environment\u2019s configuration,\
    \ which services are available, and what cloud provider the victim may be utilizing.\
    \ The discovery of these resources may inform an adversary\u2019s next steps in\
    \ the environment, such as how to perform lateral movement and which methods to\
    \ utilize for execution. "
