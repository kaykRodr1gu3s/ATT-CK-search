  Description:
  - "Adversaries may enumerate system and service logs to find useful data. These\
    \ logs may highlight various types of valuable insights for an adversary, such\
    \ as user authentication records (Account Discovery), security or vulnerable software\
    \ (Software Discovery), or hosts within a compromised network (Remote System Discovery).Host\
    \ binaries may be leveraged to collect system logs. Examples include using wevtutil.exe\
    \ or PowerShell on Windows to access and/or export security event information.[1][2]\
    \ In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage utilities such as the Azure\
    \ VM Agent\u2019s CollectGuestLogs.exe to collect security logs from cloud hosted\
    \ infrastructure.[3]Adversaries may also target centralized logging infrastructure\
    \ such as SIEMs. Logs may also be bulk exported and sent to adversary-controlled\
    \ infrastructure for offline analysis."
