Name: System Network Connections Discovery
Tactic: Discovery
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or from the
    compromised system they are currently accessing or from remote systems by querying
    for information over the network. An adversary who gains access to a system that
    is part of a cloud-based environment may map out Virtual Private Clouds or Virtual
    Networks in order to determine what systems and services are connected. The actions
    performed are likely the same types of discovery techniques depending on the operating
    system, but the resulting information may include details about the networked
    cloud environment relevant to the adversary's goals. Cloud providers may have
    different ways in which their virtual networks operate.[1][2][3] Similarly, adversaries
    who gain access to network devices may also perform similar discovery activities
    to gather information about connected systems and services.Utilities and commands
    that acquire this information include netstat, "net use," and "net session" with
    Net. In Mac and Linux, netstat and lsof can be used to list current connections.
    who -a and w can be used to show which users are currently logged in, similar
    to "net session". Additionally, built-in features native to network devices and
    Network Device CLI may be used (e.g. show ip sockets, show tcp brief).[4]
