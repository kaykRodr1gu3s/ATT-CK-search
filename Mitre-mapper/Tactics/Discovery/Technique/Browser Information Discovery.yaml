  Description:
  - Adversaries may enumerate information about browsers to learn more about compromised
    environments. Data saved by browsers (such as bookmarks, accounts, and browsing
    history) may reveal a variety of personal information about users (e.g., banking
    sites, relationships/interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal
    network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.[1]Browser
    information may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access
    to valid credentials, especially Credentials In Files associated with logins cached
    by a browser.Specific storage locations vary based on platform and/or application,
    but browser information is typically stored in local files and databases (e.g.,
    %APPDATA%/Google/Chrome).[2]
