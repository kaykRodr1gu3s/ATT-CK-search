  Description:
  - "An adversary may attempt to discover infrastructure and resources that are available\
    \ within an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environment. This includes compute\
    \ service resources such as instances, virtual machines, and snapshots as well\
    \ as resources of other services including the storage and database services.Cloud\
    \ providers offer methods such as APIs and commands issued through CLIs to serve\
    \ information about infrastructure. For example, AWS provides a DescribeInstances\
    \ API within the Amazon EC2 API that can return information about one or more\
    \ instances within an account, the ListBuckets API that returns a list of all\
    \ buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request, the HeadBucket API\
    \ to determine a bucket\u2019s existence along with access permissions of the\
    \ request sender, or the GetPublicAccessBlock API to retrieve access block configuration\
    \ for a bucket.[1][2][3][4] Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides the gcloud\
    \ compute instances list command to list all Google Compute Engine instances in\
    \ a project [5], and Azure's CLI command az vm list lists details of virtual machines.[6]\
    \ In addition to API commands, adversaries can utilize open source tools to discover\
    \ cloud storage infrastructure through Wordlist Scanning.[7]An adversary may enumerate\
    \ resources using a compromised user's access keys to determine which are available\
    \ to that user.[8] The discovery of these available resources may help adversaries\
    \ determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, such as establishing Persistence.[9]An\
    \ adversary may also use this information to change the configuration to make\
    \ the bucket publicly accessible, allowing data to be accessed without authentication.\
    \ Adversaries have also may use infrastructure discovery APIs such as DescribeDBInstances\
    \ to determine size, owner, permissions, and network ACLs of database resources.\
    \ [10] Adversaries can use this information to determine the potential value of\
    \ databases and discover the requirements to access them. Unlike in Cloud Service\
    \ Discovery, this technique focuses on the discovery of components of the provided\
    \ services rather than the services themselves."
