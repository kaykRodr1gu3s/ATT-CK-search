Name: Event Triggered Execution
Tactic: Privilege Escalation
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system
    mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Various operating
    systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other
    user activity such as running specific applications/binaries. Cloud environments
    may also support various functions and services that monitor and can be invoked
    in response to specific cloud events.[1][2][3]Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms
    as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing
    malicious code. After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify
    event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the
    event trigger is invoked.[4][5][6]Since the execution can be proxied by an account
    with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may
    be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges. '
