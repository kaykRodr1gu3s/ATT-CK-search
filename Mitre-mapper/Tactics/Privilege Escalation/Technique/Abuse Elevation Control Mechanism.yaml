Name: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism
Tactic: Privilege Escalation
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to
    gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control
    mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a
    machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform
    tasks that can be considered of higher risk. An adversary can perform several
    methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate
    privileges on a system.
