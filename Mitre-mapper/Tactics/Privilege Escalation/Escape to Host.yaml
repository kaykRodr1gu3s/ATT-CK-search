Name: Escape to Host
Tactic: Privilege Escalation
Description:
  Description:
  - "Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host.\
    \ This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the\
    \ host level or to the host itself. In principle, containerized resources should\
    \ provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from\
    \ the host environment.[1]There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a\
    \ host environment. Examples include creating a container configured to mount\
    \ the host\u2019s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary\
    \ to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host; utilizing\
    \ a privileged container to run commands or load a malicious kernel module on\
    \ the underlying host; or abusing system calls such as unshare and keyctl to escalate\
    \ privileges and steal secrets.[2][3][4][5][6][7]Additionally, an adversary may\
    \ be able to exploit a compromised container with a mounted container management\
    \ socket, such as docker.sock, to break out of the container via a Container Administration\
    \ Command.[5] Adversaries may also escape via Exploitation for Privilege Escalation,\
    \ such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access\
    \ the root directory of a host machine.[8]Gaining access to the host may provide\
    \ the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as\
    \ establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting\
    \ up a command and control channel on the host."
