  Description:
  - Adversaries may interact with the native OS application programming interface
    (API) to execute behaviors. Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling
    low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices,
    memory, and processes.[1][2] These native APIs are leveraged by the OS during
    system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as
    carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.Adversaries may abuse
    these OS API functions as a means of executing behaviors. Similar to Command and
    Scripting Interpreter, the native API and its hierarchy of interfaces provide
    mechanisms to interact with and utilize various components of a victimized system.Native
    API functions (such as NtCreateProcess) may be directed invoked via system calls
    / syscalls, but these features are also often exposed to user-mode applications
    via interfaces and libraries.[3][4][5] For example, functions such as the Windows
    API CreateProcess() or GNU fork() will allow programs and scripts to start other
    processes.[6][7] This may allow API callers to execute a binary, run a CLI command,
    load modules, etc. as thousands of similar API functions exist for various system
    operations.[8][9][10]Higher level software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET
    and macOS Cocoa, are also available to interact with native APIs. These frameworks
    typically provide language wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are
    designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.[11][12][13][14]Adversaries may use
    assembly to directly or in-directly invoke syscalls in an attempt to subvert defensive
    sensors and detection signatures such as user mode API-hooks.[15] Adversaries
    may also attempt to tamper with sensors and defensive tools associated with API
    monitoring, such as unhooking monitored functions via Disable or Modify Tools.
