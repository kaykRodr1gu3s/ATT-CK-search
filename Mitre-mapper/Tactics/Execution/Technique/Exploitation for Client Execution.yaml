Name: Exploitation for Client Execution
Tactic: Execution
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute
    code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that
    can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain
    vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code
    execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those
    that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can
    be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related
    to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target
    for exploit research and development because of their high utility.Several types
    exist:Browser-based ExploitationWeb browsers are a common target through Drive-by
    Compromise and Spearphishing Link. Endpoint systems may be compromised through
    normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing
    emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often
    do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.Office ApplicationsCommon
    office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted
    through Phishing. Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments
    or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document
    or file for the exploit to run.Common Third-party ApplicationsOther applications
    that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network
    may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash,
    which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries
    attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of
    the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to
    open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects
    within Microsoft Office documents.
Information:
  ID: T1203
  Sub-techniques: []
  Tactic: Execution
  Platforms: Linux, Windows, macOS
  System Requirements: Remote exploitation for execution requires a remotely accessible
    service reachable over the network or other vector of access such as spearphishing
    or drive-by compromise.
