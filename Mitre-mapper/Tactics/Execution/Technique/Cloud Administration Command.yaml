  Description:
  - "Adversaries may abuse cloud management services to execute commands within virtual\
    \ machines or hybrid-joined devices. Resources such as AWS Systems Manager, Azure\
    \ RunCommand, and Runbooks allow users to remotely run scripts in virtual machines\
    \ by leveraging installed virtual machine agents. Similarly, in Azure AD environments,\
    \ Microsoft Endpoint Manager allows Global or Intune Administrators to run scripts\
    \ as SYSTEM on on-premises devices joined to the Azure AD.[1][2][3]If an adversary\
    \ gains administrative access to a cloud environment, they may be able to abuse\
    \ cloud management services to execute commands in the environment\u2019s virtual\
    \ machines or on-premises hybrid-joined devices. Additionally, an adversary that\
    \ compromises a service provider or delegated administrator account may similarly\
    \ be able to leverage a Trusted Relationship to execute commands in connected\
    \ virtual machines.[4]"
