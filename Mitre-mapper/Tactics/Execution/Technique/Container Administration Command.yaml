Name: Container Administration Command
Tactic: Execution
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may abuse a container administration service to execute commands within
    a container. A container administration service such as the Docker daemon, the
    Kubernetes API server, or the kubelet may allow remote management of containers
    within an environment.[1][2][3]In Docker, adversaries may specify an entrypoint
    during container deployment that executes a script or command, or they may use
    a command such as docker exec to execute a command within a running container.[4][5]
    In Kubernetes, if an adversary has sufficient permissions, they may gain remote
    execution in a container in the cluster via interaction with the Kubernetes API
    server, the kubelet, or by running a command such as kubectl exec.[6]
