  Description:
  - Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts,
    or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer
    systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems
    come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for
    example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of Unix Shell while
    Windows installations include the Windows Command Shell and PowerShell.There are
    also cross-platform interpreters such as Python, as well as those commonly associated
    with client applications such as JavaScript and Visual Basic.Adversaries may abuse
    these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands.
    Commands and scripts can be embedded in Initial Access payloads delivered to victims
    as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries
    may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells, as well as utilize
    various Remote Services in order to achieve remote Execution.[1][2][3]
