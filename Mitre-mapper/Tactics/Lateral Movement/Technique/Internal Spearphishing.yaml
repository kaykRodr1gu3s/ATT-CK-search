  Description:
  - Adversaries may use internal spearphishing to gain access to additional information
    or exploit other users within the same organization after they already have access
    to accounts or systems within the environment. Internal spearphishing is multi-staged
    campaign where an email account is owned either by controlling the user's device
    with previously installed malware or by compromising the account credentials of
    the user. Adversaries attempt to take advantage of a trusted internal account
    to increase the likelihood of tricking the target into falling for the phish attempt.[1]Adversaries
    may leverage Spearphishing Attachment or Spearphishing Link as part of internal
    spearphishing to deliver a payload or redirect to an external site to capture
    credentials through Input Capture on sites that mimic email login interfaces.There
    have been notable incidents where internal spearphishing has been used. The Eye
    Pyramid campaign used phishing emails with malicious attachments for lateral movement
    between victims, compromising nearly 18,000 email accounts in the process.[1]
    The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) compromised email accounts at the Financial Times
    (FT) to steal additional account credentials. Once FT learned of the campaign
    and began warning employees of the threat, the SEA sent phishing emails mimicking
    the Financial Times IT department and were able to compromise even more users.[2]
