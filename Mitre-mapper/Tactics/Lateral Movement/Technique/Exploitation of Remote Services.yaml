Name: Exploitation of Remote Services
Tactic: Lateral Movement
Description:
  Description:
  - "Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal\
    \ systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs\
    \ when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service,\
    \ or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled\
    \ code.\_A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is\
    \ for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.An adversary may need\
    \ to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done\
    \ through Network Service Discovery or other Discovery methods looking for common,\
    \ vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain\
    \ patches that may indicate vulnerabilities,  or security software that may be\
    \ used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value\
    \ target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at\
    \ risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.There are\
    \ several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB\
    \ [1] and RDP [2] as well as applications that may be used within internal networks\
    \ such as MySQL [3] and web server services.[4]Depending on the permissions level\
    \ of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieve Exploitation for Privilege\
    \ Escalation as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well."

  ID: T1210
  Sub-techniques: []
  Tactic: Lateral Movement
  Platforms: Linux, Windows, macOS
  System Requirements: Unpatched software or otherwise vulnerable target. Depending
    on the target and goal, the system and exploitable service may need to be remotely
    accessible from the internal network.
