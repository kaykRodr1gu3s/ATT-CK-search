  Description:
  - Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to log into a service that accepts remote connections,
    such as telnet, SSH, and VNC. The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on
    user.In an enterprise environment, servers and workstations can be organized into
    domains. Domains provide centralized identity management, allowing users to login
    using one set of credentials across the entire network. If an adversary is able
    to obtain a set of valid domain credentials, they could login to many different
    machines using remote access protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop
    protocol (RDP).[1][2] They could also login to accessible SaaS or IaaS services,
    such as those that federate their identities to the domain. Legitimate applications
    (such as Software Deployment Tools and other administrative programs) may utilize
    Remote Services to access remote hosts. For example, Apple Remote Desktop (ARD)
    on macOS is native software used for remote management. ARD leverages a blend
    of protocols, including VNC to send the screen and control buffers and SSH for
    secure file transfer.[3][4][5] Adversaries can abuse applications such as ARD
    to gain remote code execution and perform lateral movement. In versions of macOS
    prior to 10.14, an adversary can escalate an SSH session to an ARD session which
    enables an adversary to accept TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) prompts
    without user interaction and gain access to data.[6][7][4]
