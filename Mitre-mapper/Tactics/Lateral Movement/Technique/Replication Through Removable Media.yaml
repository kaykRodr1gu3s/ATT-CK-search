Name: Replication Through Removable Media
Tactic: Lateral Movement
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped
    networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun
    features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of
    Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored
    on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate
    file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial
    Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification
    of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's
    firmware itself.Mobile devices may also be used to infect PCs with malware if
    connected via USB.[1] This infection may be achieved using devices (Android, iOS,
    etc.) and, in some instances, USB charging cables.[2][3] For example, when a smartphone
    is connected to a system, it may appear to be mounted similar to a USB-connected
    disk drive. If malware that is compatible with the connected system is on the
    mobile device, the malware could infect the machine (especially if Autorun features
    are enabled).
