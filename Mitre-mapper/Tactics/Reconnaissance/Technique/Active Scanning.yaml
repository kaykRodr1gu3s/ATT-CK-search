Name: Active Scanning
Tactic: Reconnaissance
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that
    can be used during targeting. Active scans are those where the adversary probes
    victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance
    that do not involve direct interaction.Adversaries may perform different forms
    of active scanning depending on what information they seek to gather. These scans
    can also be performed in various ways, including using native features of network
    protocols such as ICMP.[1][2] Information from these scans may reveal opportunities
    for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Search
    Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities
    or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services or
    Exploit Public-Facing Application).'
