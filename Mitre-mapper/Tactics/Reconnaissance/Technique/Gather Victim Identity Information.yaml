  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may gather information about the victim''s identity that can be used
    during targeting. Information about identities may include a variety of details,
    including personal data (ex: employee names, email addresses, etc.) as well as
    sensitive details such as credentials.Adversaries may gather this information
    in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information. Information
    about users could also be enumerated via other active means (i.e. Active Scanning)
    such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may
    reveal valid usernames in a system.[1] Information about victims may also be exposed
    to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media or Search
    Victim-Owned Websites).[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]Gathering this information may
    reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains
    or Phishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex: Compromise
    Accounts), and/or initial access (ex: Phishing or Valid Accounts).'
