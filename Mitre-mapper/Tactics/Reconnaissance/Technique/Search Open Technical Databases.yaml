Name: Search Open Technical Databases
Tactic: Reconnaissance
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may search freely available technical databases for information about
    victims that can be used during targeting. Information about victims may be available
    in online databases and repositories, such as registrations of domains/certificates
    as well as public collections of network data/artifacts gathered from traffic
    and/or scans.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]Adversaries may search in different open databases
    depending on what information they seek to gather. Information from these sources
    may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information
    or Search Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex: Acquire
    Infrastructure or Compromise Infrastructure), and/or initial access (ex: External
    Remote Services or Trusted Relationship).'
