Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may gather information about the victim''s hosts that can be used
    during targeting. Information about hosts may include a variety of details, including
    administrative data (ex: name, assigned IP, functionality, etc.) as well as specifics
    regarding its configuration (ex: operating system, language, etc.).Adversaries
    may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions
    via Active Scanning or Phishing for Information. Adversaries may also compromise
    sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from
    visitors.[1] Information about hosts may also be exposed to adversaries via online
    or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media or Search Victim-Owned Websites).
    Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance
    (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Search Open Technical Databases), establishing
    operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or
    initial access (ex: Supply Chain Compromise or External Remote Services).'
