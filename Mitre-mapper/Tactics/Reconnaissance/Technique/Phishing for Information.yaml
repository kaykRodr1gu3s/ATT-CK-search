  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information that can
    be used during targeting. Phishing for information is an attempt to trick targets
    into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information.
    Phishing for information is different from Phishing in that the objective is gathering
    data from the victim rather than executing malicious code.All forms of phishing
    are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known
    as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry
    will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted
    phishing, such as in mass credential harvesting campaigns.Adversaries may also
    try to obtain information directly through the exchange of emails, instant messages,
    or other electronic conversation means.[1][2][3][4][5] Victims may also receive
    phishing messages that direct them to call a phone number where the adversary
    attempts to collect confidential information.[6]Phishing for information frequently
    involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason
    to collect information (ex: Establish Accounts or Compromise Accounts) and/or
    sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages. Another way to accomplish this is
    by forging or spoofing[7] the identity of the sender which can be used to fool
    both the human recipient as well as automated security tools.[8] Phishing for
    information may also involve evasive techniques, such as removing or manipulating
    emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages
    (e.g., Email Hiding Rules).[9][10]'
