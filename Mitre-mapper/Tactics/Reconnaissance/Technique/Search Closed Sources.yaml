  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may search and gather information about victims from closed sources
    that can be used during targeting. Information about victims may be available
    for purchase from reputable private sources and databases, such as paid subscriptions
    to feeds of technical/threat intelligence data.[1] Adversaries may also purchase
    information from less-reputable sources such as dark web or cybercrime blackmarkets.[2]Adversaries
    may search in different closed databases depending on what information they seek
    to gather. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms
    of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information or Search Open Websites/Domains),
    establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities),
    and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services or Valid Accounts).'
