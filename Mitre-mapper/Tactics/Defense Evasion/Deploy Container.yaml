Name: Deploy Container
Tactic: Defense Evasion
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution
    or evade defenses. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute
    processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes
    that execute or download malware. In others, an adversary may deploy a new container
    configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses
    within the environment.Containers can be deployed by various means, such as via
    Docker's create and start APIs or via a web application such as the Kubernetes
    dashboard or Kubeflow.[1][2][3] Adversaries may deploy containers based on retrieved
    or built malicious images or from benign images that download and execute malicious
    payloads at runtime.[4]
