Name: Domain Policy Modification
Tactic: Defense Evasion
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain to evade defenses
    and/or escalate privileges in domain environments. Domains provide a centralized
    means of managing how computer resources (ex: computers, user accounts) can act,
    and interact with each other, on a network. The policy of the domain also includes
    configuration settings that may apply between domains in a multi-domain/forest
    environment. Modifications to domain settings may include altering domain Group
    Policy Objects (GPOs) or changing trust settings for domains, including federation
    trusts.With sufficient permissions, adversaries can modify domain policy settings.
    Since domain configuration settings control many of the interactions within the
    Active Directory (AD) environment, there are a great number of potential attacks
    that can stem from this abuse. Examples of such abuse include modifying GPOs to
    push a malicious Scheduled Task to computers throughout the domain environment[1][2][3]
    or modifying domain trusts to include an adversary controlled domain where they
    can control access tokens that will subsequently be accepted by victim domain
    resources.[4] Adversaries can also change configuration settings within the AD
    environment to implement a Rogue Domain Controller.Adversaries may temporarily
    modify domain policy, carry out a malicious action(s), and then revert the change
    to remove suspicious indicators.'
