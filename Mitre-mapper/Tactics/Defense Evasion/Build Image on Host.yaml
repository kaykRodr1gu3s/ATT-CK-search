Name: Build Image on Host
Tactic: Defense Evasion
Description:
  Description:
  - "Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses\
    \ that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry. A\
    \ remote build request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile\
    \ that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry\
    \ and then builds a custom image upon it.[1]An adversary may take advantage of\
    \ that build API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded\
    \ from their C2 server, and then they may utilize Deploy Container using that\
    \ custom image.[2][3] If the base image is pulled from a public registry, defenses\
    \ will likely not detect the image as malicious since it\u2019s a vanilla image.\
    \ If the base image already resides in a local registry, the pull may be considered\
    \ even less suspicious since the image is already in the environment. "
