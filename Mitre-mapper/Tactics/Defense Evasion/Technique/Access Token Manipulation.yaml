Name: Access Token Manipulation
Tactic: Defense Evasion
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system
    security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access
    tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate
    access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a
    different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
    When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with
    the new token.An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access
    tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can
    then be applied to an existing process (i.e. Token Impersonation/Theft) or used
    to spawn a new process (i.e. Create Process with Token). An adversary must already
    be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However,
    adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from
    the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token
    to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account
    has appropriate permissions on the remote system.[1]Any standard user can use
    the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens;
    it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms,
    such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.
