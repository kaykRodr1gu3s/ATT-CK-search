Name: Process Injection
Tactic: Defense Evasion
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses
    as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing
    arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in
    the context of another process may allow access to the process''s memory, system/network
    resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may
    also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under
    a legitimate process. There are many different ways to inject code into a process,
    many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for
    every major OS but are typically platform specific. More sophisticated samples
    may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection,
    utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as
    a communication channel. '
