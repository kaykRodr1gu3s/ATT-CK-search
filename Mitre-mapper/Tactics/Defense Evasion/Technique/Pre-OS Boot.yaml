Name: Pre-OS Boot
Tactic: Defense Evasion
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may abuse Pre-OS Boot mechanisms as a way to establish persistence
    on a system. During the booting process of a computer, firmware and various startup
    services are loaded before the operating system. These programs control flow of
    execution before the operating system takes control.[1]Adversaries may overwrite
    data in boot drivers or firmware such as BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and
    The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to persist on systems at a layer
    below the operating system. This can be particularly difficult to detect as malware
    at this level will not be detected by host software-based defenses.
