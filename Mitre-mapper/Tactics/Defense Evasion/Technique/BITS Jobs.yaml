  Description:
  - Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute code and perform various
    background tasks. Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a
    low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component
    Object Model (COM).[1][2] BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other
    applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth)
    without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented
    as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.The interface
    to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through PowerShell and the BITSAdmin
    tool.[2][3]Adversaries may abuse BITS to download (e.g. Ingress Tool Transfer),
    execute, and even clean up after running malicious code (e.g. Indicator Removal).
    BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry
    modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls.[4][5][6] BITS enabled execution
    may also enable persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum
    lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job
    completes or errors (including after system reboots).[7][4]BITS upload functionalities
    can also be used to perform Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol.[4]
