Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure that can be used during targeting.
    A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary
    operations. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains,
    and third-party web services.[1] Additionally, botnets are available for rent
    or purchase.Use of these infrastructure solutions allows adversaries to stage,
    launch, and execute operations. Solutions may help adversary operations blend
    in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contacting third-party web services
    or acquiring infrastructure to support Proxy, including from residential proxy
    services.[2][3][4] Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure
    that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure
    that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down.
