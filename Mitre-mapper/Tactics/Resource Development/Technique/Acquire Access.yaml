  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may purchase or otherwise acquire an existing access to a target
    system or network. A variety of online services and initial access broker networks
    are available to sell access to previously compromised systems.[1][2][3] In some
    cases, adversary groups may form partnerships to share compromised systems with
    each other.[4]Footholds to compromised systems may take a variety of forms, such
    as access to planted backdoors (e.g., Web Shell) or established access via External
    Remote Services. In some cases, access brokers will implant compromised systems
    with a "load" that can be used to install additional malware for paying customers.[1]By
    leveraging existing access broker networks rather than developing or obtaining
    their own initial access capabilities, an adversary can potentially reduce the
    resources required to gain a foothold on a target network and focus their efforts
    on later stages of compromise. Adversaries may prioritize acquiring access to
    systems that have been determined to lack security monitoring or that have high
    privileges, or systems that belong to organizations in a particular sector.[1][2]In
    some cases, purchasing access to an organization in sectors such as IT contracting,
    software development, or telecommunications may allow an adversary to compromise
    additional victims via a Trusted Relationship, Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,
    or even Supply Chain Compromise.Note: while this technique is distinct from other
    behaviors such as Purchase Technical Data and Credentials, they may often be used
    in conjunction (especially where the acquired foothold requires Valid Accounts).'
