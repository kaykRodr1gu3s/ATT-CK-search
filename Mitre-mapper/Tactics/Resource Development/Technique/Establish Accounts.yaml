  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may create and cultivate accounts with services that can be used
    during targeting. Adversaries can create accounts that can be used to build a
    persona to further operations. Persona development consists of the development
    of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations. This development
    could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information
    that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an
    operation using that persona or identity.[1][2]For operations incorporating social
    engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. These personas
    may be fictitious or impersonate real people. The persona may exist on a single
    site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, GitHub,
    Docker Hub, etc.). Establishing a persona may require development of additional
    documentation to make them seem real. This could include filling out profile information,
    developing social networks, or incorporating photos.[1][2]Establishing accounts
    can also include the creation of accounts with email providers, which may be directly
    leveraged for Phishing for Information or Phishing.[3]'
