  Description:
  - Adversaries may build capabilities that can be used during targeting. Rather than
    purchasing, freely downloading, or stealing capabilities, adversaries may develop
    their own capabilities in-house. This is the process of identifying development
    requirements and building solutions such as malware, exploits, and self-signed
    certificates. Adversaries may develop capabilities to support their operations
    throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.[1][2][3][4]As with legitimate
    development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing capabilities.
    The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use
    of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's development
    capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and
    maintains a degree of exclusivity to the capability.
