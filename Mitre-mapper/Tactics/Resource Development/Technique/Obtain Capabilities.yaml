Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may buy and/or steal capabilities that can be used during targeting.
    Rather than developing their own capabilities in-house, adversaries may purchase,
    freely download, or steal them. Activities may include the acquisition of malware,
    software (including licenses), exploits, certificates, and information relating
    to vulnerabilities. Adversaries may obtain capabilities to support their operations
    throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.In addition to downloading
    free malware, software, and exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase
    these capabilities from third-party entities. Third-party entities can include
    technology companies that specialize in malware and exploits, criminal marketplaces,
    or from individuals.[1][2]In addition to purchasing capabilities, adversaries
    may steal capabilities from third-party entities (including other adversaries).
    This can include stealing software licenses, malware, SSL/TLS and code-signing
    certificates, or raiding closed databases of vulnerabilities or exploits.[3]
