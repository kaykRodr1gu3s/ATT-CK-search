  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may compromise accounts with services that can be used during targeting.
    For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online
    persona may be important. Rather than creating and cultivating accounts (i.e.
    Establish Accounts), adversaries may compromise existing accounts. Utilizing an
    existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have
    a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona. A variety of methods
    exist for compromising accounts, such as gathering credentials via Phishing for
    Information, purchasing credentials from third-party sites, brute forcing credentials
    (ex: password reuse from breach credential dumps), or paying employees, suppliers
    or business partners for access to credentials.[1][2] Prior to compromising accounts,
    adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts
    to compromise to further their operation.Personas may exist on a single site or
    across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, etc.). Compromised
    accounts may require additional development, this could include filling out or
    modifying profile information, further developing social networks, or incorporating
    photos.Adversaries may directly leverage compromised email accounts for Phishing
    for Information or Phishing.'
