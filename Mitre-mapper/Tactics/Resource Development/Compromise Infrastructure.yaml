Name: Compromise Infrastructure

Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during
    targeting. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains,
    and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure
    an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the
    adversary lifecycle.[1][2][3][4] Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous
    machines to form a botnet they can leverage.Use of compromised infrastructure
    allows adversaries to stage, launch, and execute operations. Compromised infrastructure
    can help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such
    as contact with high reputation or trusted sites. For example, adversaries may
    leverage compromised infrastructure (potentially also in conjunction with Digital
    Certificates) to further blend in and support staged information gathering and/or
    Phishing campaigns.[5] Additionally, adversaries may also compromise infrastructure
    to support Proxy and/or proxyware services.[6][7]By using compromised infrastructure,
    adversaries may make it difficult to tie their actions back to them. Prior to
    targeting, adversaries may compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries.[8]
