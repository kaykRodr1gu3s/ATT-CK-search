  Description:
  - Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems
    in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. They can
    attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local
    and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done
    in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption
    or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in
    cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.[1][2][3][4]In the case of ransomware,
    it is typical that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images, videos,
    audio, text, and source code files will be encrypted (and often renamed and/or
    tagged with specific file markers). Adversaries may need to first employ other
    behaviors, such as File and Directory Permissions Modification or System Shutdown/Reboot,
    in order to unlock and/or gain access to manipulate these files.[5] In some cases,
    adversaries may encrypt critical system files, disk partitions, and the MBR.[3]
    To maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for encrypting
    data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other
    attack techniques like Valid Accounts, OS Credential Dumping, and SMB/Windows
    Admin Shares.[2][3] Encryption malware may also leverage Internal Defacement,
    such as changing victim wallpapers, or otherwise intimidate victims by sending
    ransom notes or other messages to connected printers (known as "print bombing").[6]In
    cloud environments, storage objects within compromised accounts may also be encrypted.[7]
