  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may overwrite or corrupt the flash memory contents of system BIOS
    or other firmware in devices attached to a system in order to render them inoperable
    or unable to boot, thus denying the availability to use the devices and/or the
    system.[1] Firmware is software that is loaded and executed from non-volatile
    memory on hardware devices in order to initialize and manage device functionality.
    These devices may include the motherboard, hard drive, or video cards.In general,
    adversaries may manipulate, overwrite, or corrupt firmware in order to deny the
    use of the system or devices. For example, corruption of firmware responsible
    for loading the operating system for network devices may render the network devices
    inoperable.[2][3] Depending on the device, this attack may also result in Data
    Destruction. '
