  Description:
  - Adversaries may steal monetary resources from targets through extortion, social
    engineering, technical theft, or other methods aimed at their own financial gain
    at the expense of the availability of these resources for victims. Financial theft
    is the ultimate objective of several popular campaign types including extortion
    by ransomware,[1] business email compromise (BEC) and fraud,[2] "pig butchering,"[3]
    bank hacking,[4] and exploiting cryptocurrency networks.[5] Adversaries may Compromise
    Accounts to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds.[6] In the case of business
    email compromise or email fraud, an adversary may utilize Impersonation of a trusted
    entity. Once the social engineering is successful, victims can be deceived into
    sending money to financial accounts controlled by an adversary.[2] This creates
    the potential for multiple victims (i.e., compromised accounts as well as the
    ultimate monetary loss) in incidents involving financial theft.[7]Extortion by
    ransomware may occur, for example, when an adversary demands payment from a victim
    after Data Encrypted for Impact [8] and Exfiltration of data, followed by threatening
    public exposure unless payment is made to the adversary.[9]Due to the potentially
    immense business impact of financial theft, an adversary may abuse the possibility
    of financial theft and seeking monetary gain to divert attention from their true
    goals such as Data Destruction and business disruption.[10]
