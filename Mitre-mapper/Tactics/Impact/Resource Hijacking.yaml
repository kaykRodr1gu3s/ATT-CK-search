  Description:
  - "Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive\
    \ tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability. One common\
    \ purpose for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions of cryptocurrency\
    \ networks and earn virtual currency. Adversaries may consume enough system resources\
    \ to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines to become unresponsive.[1]\
    \ Servers and cloud-based systems are common targets because of the high potential\
    \ for available resources, but user endpoint systems may also be compromised and\
    \ used for Resource Hijacking and cryptocurrency mining.[2] Containerized environments\
    \ may also be targeted due to the ease of deployment via exposed APIs and the\
    \ potential for scaling mining activities by deploying or compromising multiple\
    \ containers within an environment or cluster.[3][4]Additionally, some cryptocurrency\
    \ mining malware identify then kill off processes for competing malware to ensure\
    \ it\u2019s not competing for resources.[5]Adversaries may also use malware that\
    \ leverages a system's network bandwidth as part of a botnet in order to facilitate\
    \ Network Denial of Service campaigns and/or to seed malicious torrents.[6] Alternatively,\
    \ they may engage in proxyjacking by selling use of the victims' network bandwidth\
    \ and IP address to proxyware services.[7]"
