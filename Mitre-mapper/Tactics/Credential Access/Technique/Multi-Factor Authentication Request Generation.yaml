Name: Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation
Tactic: Credential Access
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms
    and gain access to accounts by generating MFA requests sent to users.Adversaries
    in possession of credentials to Valid Accounts may be unable to complete the login
    process if they lack access to the 2FA or MFA mechanisms required as an additional
    credential and security control. To circumvent this, adversaries may abuse the
    automatic generation of push notifications to MFA services such as Duo Push, Microsoft
    Authenticator, Okta, or similar services to have the user grant access to their
    account.In some cases, adversaries may continuously repeat login attempts in order
    to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls, potentially
    resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request in response
    to "MFA fatigue."[1][2][3]
