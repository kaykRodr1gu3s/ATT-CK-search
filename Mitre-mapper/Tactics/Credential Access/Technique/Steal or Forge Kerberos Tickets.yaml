Name: Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets
Tactic: Credential Access

  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging
    Kerberos tickets to enable Pass the Ticket. Kerberos is an authentication protocol
    widely used in modern Windows domain environments. In Kerberos environments, referred
    to as "realms", there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution
    Center (KDC).[1] Clients request access to a service and through the exchange
    of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having
    successfully authenticated. The KDC is responsible for both authentication and
    ticket granting.  Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets
    or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.On Windows, the built-in klist
    utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets.[2]Linux systems
    on Active Directory domains store Kerberos credentials locally in the credential
    cache file referred to as the "ccache". The credentials are stored in the ccache
    file while they remain valid and generally while a user''s session lasts.[3] On
    modern Redhat Enterprise Linux systems, and derivative distributions, the System
    Security Services Daemon (SSSD) handles Kerberos tickets. By default SSSD maintains
    a copy of the ticket database that can be found in /var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb
    as well as the corresponding key located in /var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey.
    Both files require root access to read. If an adversary is able to access the
    database and key, the credential cache Kerberos blob can be extracted and converted
    into a usable Kerberos ccache file that adversaries may use for Pass the Ticket.
    The ccache file may also be converted into a Windows format using tools such as
    Kekeo.[4][5][6]Kerberos tickets on macOS are stored in a standard ccache format,
    similar to Linux. By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through
    the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller''s environment
    to determine access. The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced
    by the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and the KRB5CCNAME environment variable
    which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon.
    Users can interact with ticket storage using kinit, klist, ktutil, and kcc built-in
    binaries or via Apple''s native Kerberos framework. Adversaries can use open source
    tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework
    to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user''s TGT or Service Tickets.[7][8]'
