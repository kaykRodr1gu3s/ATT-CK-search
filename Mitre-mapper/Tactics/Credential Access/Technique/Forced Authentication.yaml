Name: Forced Authentication
Tactic: Credential Access
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically
    provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.The
    Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication
    and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing. When
    a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically
    attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to
    the remote system. [1] This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so
    that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.Web Distributed
    Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is also typically used by Windows systems as
    a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails. WebDAV is an extension of HTTP
    and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443. [2] [3]Adversaries may take
    advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced
    SMB/WebDAV authentication. An adversary can send an attachment to a user through
    spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by
    the adversary (i.e. Template Injection), or place a specially crafted file on
    navigation path for privileged accounts (e.g. .SCF file placed on desktop) or
    on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim(s). When the user's system
    accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information,
    including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary controlled
    server. [4] With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line
    Brute Force cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials. [5]There are several
    different ways this can occur. [6] Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:A
    spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically
    loaded when the document is opened (i.e. Template Injection). The document can
    include, for example, a request similar to file[:]//[remote address]/Normal.dotm
    to trigger the SMB request. [7]A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename
    pointing to an external reference such as [remote address]pic.png that will force
    the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather
    credentials. [7]
