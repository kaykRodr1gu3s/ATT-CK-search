Name: Modify Authentication Process
Tactic: Credential Access
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user
    credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication
    process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server
    (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable
    authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins
    on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials.
    By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate
    to a service or system without using Valid Accounts.Adversaries may maliciously
    modify a part of this process to either reveal credentials or bypass authentication
    mechanisms. Compromised credentials or access may be used to bypass access controls
    placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used
    for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such
    as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop.
