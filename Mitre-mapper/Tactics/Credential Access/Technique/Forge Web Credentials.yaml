Name: Forge Web Credentials
Tactic: Credential Access
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to
    web applications or Internet services. Web applications and services (hosted in
    cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies, tokens,
    or other materials to authenticate and authorize user access.Adversaries may generate
    these credential materials in order to gain access to web resources. This differs
    from Steal Web Session Cookie, Steal Application Access Token, and other similar
    behaviors in that the credentials are new and forged by the adversary, rather
    than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users.The generation of web credentials
    often requires secret values, such as passwords, Private Keys, or other cryptographic
    seed values.[1] Adversaries may also forge tokens by taking advantage of features
    such as the AssumeRole and GetFederationToken APIs in AWS, which allow users to
    request temporary security credentials (i.e., Temporary Elevated Cloud Access),
    or the zmprov gdpak command in Zimbra, which generates a pre-authentication key
    that can be used to generate tokens for any user in the domain.[2][3]Once forged,
    adversaries may use these web credentials to access resources (ex: Use Alternate
    Authentication Material), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication
    protection mechanisms.[4][5][6] '
