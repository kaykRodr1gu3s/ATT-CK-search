Name: Exploitation for Credential Access
Tactic: Credential Access
Description:
  Description:
  - "Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials.\
    \ Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage\
    \ of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system\
    \ software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.\_Credentialing\
    \ and authentication mechanisms may be targeted for exploitation by adversaries\
    \ as a means to gain access to useful credentials or circumvent the process to\
    \ gain authenticated access to systems. One example of this is MS14-068, which\
    \ targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user\
    \ permissions.[1][2] Another example of this is replay attacks, in which the adversary\
    \ intercepts data packets sent between parties and then later replays these packets.\
    \ If services don't properly validate authentication requests, these replayed\
    \ packets may allow an adversary to impersonate one of the parties and gain unauthorized\
    \ access or privileges.[3][4][5]Such exploitation has been demonstrated in cloud\
    \ environments as well. For example, adversaries have exploited vulnerabilities\
    \ in public cloud infrastructure that allowed for unintended authentication token\
    \ creation and renewal.[6]Exploitation for credential access may also result in\
    \ Privilege Escalation depending on the process targeted or credentials obtained."
