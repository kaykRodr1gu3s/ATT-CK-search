Name: Multi-Factor Authentication Interception
Tactic: Credential Access
Description:
  Description:
  - "Adversaries may target multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms, (i.e., smart\
    \ cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials that can be used\
    \ to access systems, services, and network resources. Use of MFA is recommended\
    \ and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone,\
    \ but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept\
    \ and bypass these security mechanisms. If a smart card is used for multi-factor\
    \ authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password\
    \ associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and\
    \ access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource\
    \ using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware\
    \ token. [1]Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other\
    \ hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's\
    \ personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the\
    \ one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling\
    \ adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to\
    \ both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes).\
    \ [2]Other methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate.\
    \ It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email,\
    \ SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable\
    \ to interception. Service providers can also be targeted: for example, an adversary\
    \ may compromise an SMS messaging service in order to steal MFA codes sent to\
    \ users\u2019 phones.[3]"
