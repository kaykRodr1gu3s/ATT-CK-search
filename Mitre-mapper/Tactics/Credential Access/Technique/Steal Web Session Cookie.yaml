Name: Steal Web Session Cookie
Tactic: Credential Access
Description:
  Description:
  - 'An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them
    to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user
    without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies
    as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.Cookies
    are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is
    not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the
    browser, and in network traffic to remote systems. Additionally, other applications
    on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory
    (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). Session cookies can be used
    to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.[1]There are several examples
    of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.[2][3] There
    are also open source frameworks such as Evilginx2 and Muraena that can gather
    session cookies through a malicious proxy (ex: Adversary-in-the-Middle) that can
    be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.[4][5]After an adversary
    acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a Web Session Cookie technique
    to login to the corresponding web application.'
