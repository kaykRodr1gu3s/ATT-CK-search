Name: Adversary-in-the-Middle
Tactic: Credential Access
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices
    using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors
    such as Network Sniffing, Transmitted Data Manipulation, or replay attacks (Exploitation
    for Credential Access). By abusing features of common networking protocols that
    can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries
    may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they
    can collect information or perform additional actions.[1]For example, adversaries
    may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as
    preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional
    malware.[2][3][4] Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position
    in order to intercept user credentials and session cookies.[5] Downgrade Attacks
    can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less
    secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption
    algorithm.[6][7][8]Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt
    to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in Transmitted Data Manipulation. Adversaries
    can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate
    destination, potentially to Impair Defenses and/or in support of a Network Denial
    of Service.
