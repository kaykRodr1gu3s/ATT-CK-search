Name: Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates
Tactic: Credential Access
Description:
  Description:
  - "Adversaries may steal or forge certificates used for authentication to access\
    \ remote systems or resources. Digital certificates are often used to sign and\
    \ encrypt messages and/or files. Certificates are also used as authentication\
    \ material. For example, Azure AD device certificates and Active Directory Certificate\
    \ Services (AD CS) certificates bind to an identity and can be used as credentials\
    \ for domain accounts.[1][2]Authentication certificates can be both stolen and\
    \ forged. For example, AD CS certificates can be stolen from encrypted storage\
    \ (in the Registry or files)[3], misplaced certificate files (i.e. Unsecured Credentials),\
    \ or directly from the Windows certificate store via various crypto APIs.[4][5][6]\
    \ With appropriate enrollment rights, users and/or machines within a domain can\
    \ also request and/or manually renew certificates from enterprise certificate\
    \ authorities (CA). This enrollment process defines various settings and permissions\
    \ associated with the certificate. Of note, the certificate\u2019s extended key\
    \ usage (EKU) values define signing, encryption, and authentication use cases,\
    \ while the certificate\u2019s subject alternative name (SAN) values define the\
    \ certificate owner\u2019s alternate names.[7]Abusing certificates for authentication\
    \ credentials may enable other behaviors such as Lateral Movement. Certificate-related\
    \ misconfigurations may also enable opportunities for Privilege Escalation, by\
    \ way of allowing users to impersonate or assume privileged accounts or permissions\
    \ via the identities (SANs) associated with a certificate. These abuses may also\
    \ enable Persistence via stealing or forging certificates that can be used as\
    \ Valid Accounts for the duration of the certificate's validity, despite user\
    \ password resets. Authentication certificates can also be stolen and forged for\
    \ machine accounts.Adversaries who have access to root (or subordinate) CA certificate\
    \ private keys (or mechanisms protecting/managing these keys) may also establish\
    \ Persistence by forging arbitrary authentication certificates for the victim\
    \ domain (known as \"golden\" certificates).[7] Adversaries may also target certificates\
    \ and related services in order to access other forms of credentials, such as\
    \ Golden Ticket ticket-granting tickets (TGT) or NTLM plaintext.[7]"
