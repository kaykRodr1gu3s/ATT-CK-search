  Description:
  - Adversaries may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.
    Passwords are stored in several places on a system, depending on the operating
    system or application holding the credentials. There are also specific applications
    and services that store passwords to make them easier for users to manage and
    maintain, such as password managers and cloud secrets vaults. Once credentials
    are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted
    information.
