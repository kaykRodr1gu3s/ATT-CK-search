Tactic: Initial Access
Description:
  Description:
  - Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt
    by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.Supply chain
    compromise can take place at any stage of the supply chain including:Manipulation
    of development toolsManipulation of a development environmentManipulation of source
    code repositories (public or private)Manipulation of source code in open-source
    dependenciesManipulation of software update/distribution mechanismsCompromised/infected
    system images (multiple cases of removable media infected at the factory)[1][2]
    Replacement of legitimate software with modified versionsSales of modified/counterfeit
    products to legitimate distributorsShipment interdictionWhile supply chain compromise
    can impact any component of hardware or software, adversaries looking to gain
    execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in
    software distribution or update channels.[3][4][5] Targeting may be specific to
    a desired victim set or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of
    consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.[6][3][5]
    Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications
    may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.[7]
