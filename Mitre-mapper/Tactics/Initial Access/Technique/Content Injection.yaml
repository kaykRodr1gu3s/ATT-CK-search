Name: Content Injection
Tactic: Initial Access
Description:
  Description:
  - 'Adversaries may gain access and continuously communicate with victims by injecting
    malicious content into systems through online network traffic. Rather than luring
    victims to malicious payloads hosted on a compromised website (i.e., Drive-by
    Target followed by Drive-by Compromise), adversaries may initially access victims
    through compromised data-transfer channels where they can manipulate traffic and/or
    inject their own content. These compromised online network channels may also be
    used to deliver additional payloads (i.e., Ingress Tool Transfer) and other data
    to already compromised systems.[1]Adversaries may inject content to victim systems
    in various ways, including:From the middle, where the adversary is in-between
    legitimate online client-server communications (Note: this is similar but distinct
    from Adversary-in-the-Middle, which describes AiTM activity solely within an enterprise
    environment) [2]From the side, where malicious content is injected and races to
    the client as a fake response to requests of a legitimate online server [3]Content
    injection is often the result of compromised upstream communication channels,
    for example at the level of an internet service provider (ISP) as is the case
    with "lawful interception."[3][1][4]'
