  Description:
  - Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms
    of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted,
    known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry
    will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted
    phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.Adversaries may send victims
    emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious
    code on victim systems. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services,
    like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques,
    such as posing as a trusted source, as well as evasive techniques such as removing
    or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused
    to send messages (e.g., Email Hiding Rules).[1][2] Another way to accomplish this
    is by forging or spoofing[3] the identity of the sender which can be used to fool
    both the human recipient as well as automated security tools.[4] Victims may also
    receive phishing messages that instruct them to call a phone number where they
    are directed to visit a malicious URL, download malware,[5][6] or install adversary-accessible
    remote management tools onto their computer (i.e., User Execution).[7]
