  Description:
  - Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other
    computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain
    access. Rather than just connecting and distributing payloads via removable storage
    (i.e. Replication Through Removable Media), more robust hardware additions can
    be used to introduce new functionalities and/or features into a system that can
    then be abused.While public references of usage by threat actors are scarce, many
    red teams/penetration testers leverage hardware additions for initial access.
    Commercial and open source products can be leveraged with capabilities such as
    passive network tapping, network traffic modification (i.e. Adversary-in-the-Middle),
    keystroke injection, kernel memory reading via DMA, addition of new wireless access
    to an existing network, and others.[1][2][3][4]
